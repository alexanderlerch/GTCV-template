This is a quick hack for a CV template according to the GT definitions.

Please note the following:
1. the main file is cv.tex
2. the required packages are listed in packages.tex
3. bibtex has to run for all bibunits individually (see bibunit documentation for details)
4. in the case of a list/bibliography interrupted by a section heading, the counter has to be adjusted manually
5. title page information is entered in definitions.tex
